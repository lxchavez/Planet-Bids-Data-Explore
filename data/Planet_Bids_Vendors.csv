Interoperability and sharing of information - voice, data and visual - are critical to a successful Emergency Response mission. AGSI has embedded a seamless process enabling technologies into the network IT, telecommunications and video backbone for clients who are suddenly brought together during a disaster response, or even experiencing a simple Mutual Aid situation. Four primary satellite-based/interoperability systems are used to accomplish these objectives: ? Agiosat Satellite Phone Service (SPS) L-band satellite telephony, utilizing the newly fielded IsatPhone Pro; ? Agiosat Enhanced Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN) Service – L-band, 3G speed satellite services with simultaneous voice, video, data and two-way radio; ? AGSI North American Public Safety Network (NAPSN) and North American Medical Coordination Network (NAMCN), a Ku-band based system that provides voice telephony, VTC/Telepresence, broadcast video, data transmission and two-way radio communication under a common, fully interoperable umbrella to Public Safety, Medical Agencies and Healthcare Enterprises; ? Agiosat Interoperable Radio Services (AIRS), an open standards, server-based network embedded, two-way PTT system that is software and hardware agnostic, purpose built to blend the wide variety of disparate terrestrial network applications, including Smartphones, digital and analog LMR, desktop computer and hardware radio consoles and various RoIP products, both with one another, and satellite-based applications designed to operate in any situation. Agiosat is the only service provider in the U.S. where both BGAN and VSAT communications networks are interoperable. Agiosat’s VSAT systems on the NAPSN have faster response times due to the system’s ability to communicate in both star and mesh modes. Furthermore Agiosat’s Hosted BGAN solution differs from any other service provider. We control the data at our earth station facilities, which ensures the customer a better quality of service. Other service providers, by contrast, transmit the data to a central point out of their control over the unsecure internet. Agiosat has the facilities, including multi coast teleports with redundant backup systems, so that if anything goes wrong in one teleport everything can be switched over to the other teleport to seamlessly continue operations. Agiosat is the teleport operator; we do not rent space in someone else’s facility. As a direct telecommunications provider, Agiosat, like any phone company issues both the dial tone and phone numbers on our system. Agiosat has 24/7 U. S. based customer support service. Staff is constantly monitoring and maintaining the network to provide the best and most reliable service to our customers. Agiosat’s network allows for end user VPNs, enabling both data encryption and access to private networks.",
